                        <span>
                                Note this application is currently in early development. Outputs are largely untested. For now a lot of what I have is just
                                proof of concept. Plus most of the outputs are based on my limited syntax knowledge and off the top of my head; prone to error
                                and not verbose.
                        </span>

                        <span> This project is constantly being updated and undergoing near daily changes. </span>

                                        Endpoint generation is restricted to single primary keys. For best results use <code>+</code> option with the table.
                                        This helps me make a RESTful api.
                                </li>
                                <li>Previously attempted join logic is removed and on pause while I lock down the easier stuff.</li>
                                <li>The NodeJS Express endpoints are temporary removed as I focus my time on the Go api.</li>
                                <li>Removed the "read options" for now in favor of the full read.</li>

                        <span> Lots of good progress, recently added unique indexes on foreign keys. Its been a while since I tested its outputs. </span>

                        <span>
                                A work in progress too, but most promising. As of testing the code runs, but thats as far as my testing has gone. For now I took
                                the sql queries and included them into the Go code to remove the need for stored procedure or functions. Plans to add a toggle
                                may follow, not sure yet.
                        </span>

                        <span>
                                This is mostly proof of concept, and very little time spent so far. I plan to make a proper implementation with Go templates and
                                SSR.
