                        <h2>My Journey</h2>
                        <p>
                                This project kicked off during a road trip when I discovered how enjoyable it is to generate SQL queries. I had a great time
                                with it, but eventually set it aside for a few months. Then, a colleague introduced me to the Phoenix Framework, and I was
                                immediately intrigued. Its built-in features felt like a refreshing change, designed by developers who were tired of the same
                                old web development hassles. I dove into the documentation and gained a solid grasp of both Phoenix and general web design best
                                practices. A lot of this was new to me, and it sparked my desire to create something unique using what I'd learned.
                        </p>
                        <p>Why not just use Phoenix?</p>
                        <ul>
                                <li>
                                        While I'm excited about what I can learn from Elixir and its new problem-solving methods (like the functional paradigm),
                                        the language is not used where I work.
                                </li>
                                <li>Elixir's atoms and macros are fascinating, but I struggle to fully trust them; they can feel a bit arbitrary.</li>
                                <li>
                                        I wanted to step away from JavaScript in my free time, but the lack of a strict type system in Elixir reminds me of
                                        JavaScript. For instance, I wasted 30 minutes debugging <strong>xyzHtml</strong> versus <strong>xyzHTML</strong>.
                                </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                                Despite these challenges, my interest in the Phoenix Framework is still strong, especially in its innovative approach to web
                                design and problem-solving. Ultimately, I hope to create something special that reflects all the knowledge I've gained.

                        <h2>Development Stage</h2>
                        <p>
                                This project is still a work in progress, with updates rolling out about every week. Right now, I'm focusing on getting the
                                application up and running, so most of my efforts are pretty exploratory. I'm prioritizing the basics for now, putting off more
                                complex features like relational stuff in Go templates and repositories. I've also stripped away some older code generators,
                                like NodeJS Express and other read endpoints.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Go API</h2>
                        <p>
                                I've been testing outputs and things have been going well so far, but I'm constantly dealing with edge cases, so you might run
                                into a few too.

                        <h3>Pros</h3>
                        <p>
                                The organized structure makes it easy to navigate and maintain the code. Plus, being able to reuse code across different
                                components really boosts productivity, saving time when you're developing new features. This setup is also great for
                                scalability, meaning you can add new functionalities without messing up the existing code.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Cons</h3>
                        <p>
                                On the flip side, this structure can feel a bit overkill for smaller projects, which might add unnecessary complexity. There's
                                also a learning curve to really get the hang of everything. And sometimes, it can lead to overengineering, where simpler
                                solutions get overlooked in favor of more complicated ones, which can slow things down.
                        </p>

                        <h2>PostgreSQL</h2>
                        <p>
                                Progress has been promising, with recent additions of unique indexes on foreign keys. It's been a while since I tested the
                                outputs, but it did function with the current default example for the Go app.
