                        <h2>My Journey</h2>
                        <p>
                                This project began on a road trip, where I discovered the joy of generating SQL queries. It was fun, but after a few months, I
                                set it aside. Recently, a colleague introduced me to the Phoenix Framework, and I was instantly intrigued. Its extensive
                                built-in features felt like a breath of fresh air, crafted by developers tired of repetitive web development challenges. I dove
                                into the startup documentation and gained a solid foundational understanding—not just of Phoenix, but of web design as a whole
                                and its best practices. Much of this content was new to me, and it sparked a desire to create something of my own using these
                                insights.
                        </p>
                        <p>However, I faced a few obstacles:</p>
                        <ul>
                                <li>
                                        I appreciate what I could learn from Elixir and the new problem-solving approaches it offers (i.e. functional paradigm),
                                        but it's not a skill that directly translates to my current work environment.
                                </li>
                                <li>While I find Elixir's atoms and macros fascinating, I struggle to "just trust" them, feeling that it was too arbitrary.</li>
                                <li>
                                        I wanted to shift away from JavaScript in my free time, and the lack of a strict type system in Elixir is similar to
                                        JavaScript. For example, I spent a frustrating 30 minutes debugging
                                        <strong>xyzHtml</strong> versus <strong>xyzHTML</strong>.
                                </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                                Despite these challenges, my interest in the Phoenix Framework remains, particularly in its approach to web design and
                                problem-solving. Ultimately, I aim to create something unique that reflects the knowledge I've gained.

                        <h2>Development Stage</h2>
                        <p>
                                Please note that this application is currently in early development. Many outputs are untested and primarily serve as proof of
                                concept. The current functionality is based on my limited syntax knowledge and quick ideas, which means it's prone to errors and
                                lacks detail.
                        </p>
                        <p>This project is continuously evolving, with updates approximately every week.</p>
                        <p>
                                Much of the current work is exploratory, focused on getting the application up and running. I plan to perform a cleanup pass
                                soon.
                        </p>

                                <li>
                                        Endpoint generation is currently limited to single primary keys. For optimal results, please use the
                                        <strong>+</strong> option with the table, as it helps in creating a RESTful API.
                                </li>
                                <li>I have paused attempts at join logic while I focus on more straightforward implementations.</li>
                                <li>NodeJS Express endpoints have been temporarily removed as I prioritize development on the Go API.</li>
                                <li>The "read options" feature has been set aside in favor of a full read functionality for now.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                                This project aims to develop a robust application boilerplate to facilitate larger projects. Initial manual testing indicates
                                that it works well with simple tables, though I still need to address some missing imports.
                        </p>

                        <pre>
    cd cmd/mysite/
    go get
    go vet
    # fix issues
    go run .

                        <h3>Pros</h3>
                        <p>
                                The clear organization of the Go app structure facilitates easy navigation and efficient code maintenance. Code reuse across
                                different components enhances productivity by saving time during feature development. This setup supports scalability, allowing
                                for the addition of new functionalities without disrupting existing code.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Cons</h3>
                        <p>
                                Despite its advantages, the structure can sometimes feel excessive for smaller projects, leading to unnecessary complexity.
                                There is also a learning curve associated with fully grasping the nuances of this setup. Furthermore, the potential for
                                overengineering exists, as simpler solutions may be overlooked in favor of more complicated ones, which can hinder efficiency.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Example Breakdown</h3>

                        <p>
                                Progress has been promising, with recent additions of unique indexes on foreign keys. It's been a while since I tested the
                                outputs, but it did function with the current default example for the Go app.
                        </p>

                                <li>The update procedure ignores attributes marked as read-only.</li>
                                <li>
                                        Two read functions are generated:
                                        <ol>
                                                <li>Single read function allows access by primary key.</li>
