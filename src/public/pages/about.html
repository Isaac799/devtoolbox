                                Note this application is currently in early development. Outputs are largely untested. For now a lot of what I have is just
                                proof of concept. Plus most of the outputs are based on my limited syntax knowledge and off the top of my head; prone to error
                                and not verbose.

                        <span>
                                Currently testing the outputs on this one. Lots of good progress, most outputs seem to run and are able to be called but testing
                                it manually is a chore. No promises tho.

                                A work in progress too, but most promising. While <code>go vet</code> works, I have no clue if it <em>actually</em> works. For
                                now I took the sql queries and included them into the Go code to remove the need for stored procedure or functions. Plans to add
                                a toggle may follow, not sure yet. For now all inputs are passed in via the body, except reads which are attempted to be parsed
                                from query params. May be looking to utilize the path instead for a more "restful" structure.

                        <span> This is mostly proof of concept, endpoints likely will work, but postgres configuration will need some tweaking. </span>

                        This is mostly proof of concept too, very little time spent so far.
