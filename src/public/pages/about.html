                        <h2>My Journey</h2>
                        <p>
                                This whole project started on a road trip when I realized how much fun generating SQL queries could be. I dove into it, but then
                                put it on hold for a few months. Then a colleague showed me the Phoenix Framework, and I was hooked. It felt like a breath of
                                fresh air, built by folks who were fed up with the usual web development headaches. I spent some time digging through the
                                documentation and picked up a lot about Phoenix and web design best practices. It was mostly new territory for me, but it
                                reignited my passion to create something unique with what I learned.
                        </p>
                        <p>So, why not just stick with Phoenix?</p>
                        <ul>
                                <li>
                                        I'm really curious about Elixir and its different approaches to problem-solving, especially with the functional
                                        paradigm, but it's not something I use at work.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                        Elixir's atoms and macros are intriguing, but I still find them a bit hard to trust - they seem a little arbitrary at
                                        times.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                        I wanted to step away from JavaScript in my free time, but Elixir's lack of a strict type system reminds me too much of
                                        it. I've wasted too much time debugging <strong>xyzHtml</strong> versus <strong>xyzHTML</strong>.
                                </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                                Despite these bumps in the road, I'm still really excited about the Phoenix Framework and its innovative take on web design and
                                problem-solving. I'm hoping to build something special that showcases everything I've picked up along the way.

                        <h2>Development Stage</h2>
                        <p>
                                This project is still very much a work in progress, with updates coming out about once a week. Right now, I'm focused on getting
                                the app up and running, so I'm mostly exploring different ideas.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                There's some interesting stuff in here - I just added pagination, which I think is pretty cool. But, as with most things, I
                                might change how it's implemented down the line. For example, there's a lot of duplicated code for transactions, and I keep
                                reading template files unnecessarily. I know these are things I need to tackle, just not at the moment.
                        </p>

                <section>
                        <h2>PostgreSQL</h2>
                        <p>
                                Things are looking promising, especially with the recent addition of unique indexes on foreign keys. It's been a while since I
                                tested the outputs, but it worked with the default example for the Go app.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                I want to implement migrations and seed data, something I picked up while learning Phoenix, but I haven't gotten around to it
                                yet. Migrations would help me manage changes to the database schema as the project evolves, and seeding data would streamline
                                setting up the initial state for development and testing. I see how useful these features could be and plan to add them once I
                                get more settled with everything else.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Go</h2>
                        <p>
                                I've been testing outputs and things have been going well so far, but I'm constantly dealing with edge cases, so you might run
                                into a few too.

                        <h3>Pros</h3>
                        <p>
                                The organized structure makes it easier to navigate and maintain the code. Reusing code across components definitely speeds
                                things up when I'm adding new features. Plus, it scales well, so I can add functionality without breaking what's already in
                                place.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Cons</h3>
                        <p>
                                On the downside, this structure can feel a bit much for smaller projects, adding unnecessary complexity. There's a learning
                                curve to get the hang of everything, and it can lead to over engineering - sometimes simpler solutions get ignored, which can
                                slow things down.
