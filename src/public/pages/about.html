                        <h2>Development Stage</h2>

                        Note this application is currently in early development. Outputs are largely untested. For now a lot of what I have is just proof of
                        concept. Plus most of the outputs are based on my limited syntax knowledge and off the top of my head; prone to error and not verbose.

                        <h2>PostgreSQL</h2>
                        Currently testing the outputs on this one. Lots of good progress, most outputs seem to run and are able to be called. No promises tho.
                        <ul>
                                <li>All aspects (entities, functions, procedures, joins...) take into account a composite primary key</li>
                                <li>The update procedure ignores attributes marked as readonly</li>
                                <li>
                                        Up to three read functions are generated.
                                        <ol>
                                                <li>Single is basic, letting you read by primary key</li>
                                                <li>
                                                        Options gives a trimmed down list if things in the table
                                                        <ul>
                                                                <li>automatically done if an attribute is named: name, label, value, code, or tag.</li>
                                                                <li>aimed to help with dropdown list / selection needs</li>
                                                        </ul>
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                        Joined recursively grabs foreign attributes too
                                                        <ul>
                                                                <li>Automatically generated if a foreign key is present</li>
                                                                <li>Limited for self references</li>
                                                        </ul>
                                                </li>
                                        </ol>
                                </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Node JS Express</h2>
                        This is mostly proof of concept, endpoints likely will work, but postgres configuration will need some tweaking.
                        <ul>
                                <li>GET, PUT, POST, DELETE endpoints that utilize the PostgreSQL functions and procedures</li>
                                <li>Handholding when making requests, checking for things missed that it expects on a request</li>
                                <li>Error handling for failed queries</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Html</h2>
                        This is mostly proof of concept too, very little time spent so far.
                        <ul>
                                <li>Form for each CRUD operation needed that aligns with all endpoints created by Node JS Express</li>
                        </ul>
